# Csv_to_Kml_Converter

The main goal of the "Csv_to_Kml_Converter" is to provide automatically generated KML file of Wifi networks from CSV file.

KML (formerly known as Keyhole Markup Language) is an XML-based file format for displaying information in a geographic context.
KML information can be drawn in many earth-based browsers, including ArcGIS Earth and ArcGIS Pro. KML Version 2.2 has been adopted as an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard.
The complete KML specification can be found at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language.

This API contains easy interface for user so just IDE and follow the instructions (this version is warking but it's not finished yet: I'll gone to change matrix for list and need to work on some exception )
But if you haven't a problem with сomplexity and memory *(It's not using to much and runing fast but will faster soon) so this API is for you.

You can read about functions I used at javadoc (doc folder) and see some examples at "Examples folder".
